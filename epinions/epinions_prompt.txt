## Guidance

Your job is to rewrite the review into paragraphs, with proper casing and punctuation suitable for an online opinion website that bans the use of colons (:) in it's reviews.

From the review also try and infer the category of the item being reviewed (category), the manufacturer of the item (manufacturer), the model number (model) and generate a short one line title (title) for the updated review.  

Where you can't reply "unknown"
